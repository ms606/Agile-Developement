# Agile-Developement


##### Why are organizations adopting agile
1. Volatility 
2. Uncertainty
3. Complexity
4. Ambiguity 

The abbreviated term VUCA. 

##### Organizations that go through Agile transformation have also benefited from:
Build the right products
Early risk reduction
Built-in quality
Culture and morale

New Terms:
* Muda: Lean principles refer to the Japanese term Muda as waste; Agile teams focus on the removal of non-value adding tasks that are seen as Muda.
* VUCA: Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity
* WIP (Work in Progress): The work that has been started but not yet completed
* Growth Mindset: The mindset that an individual's abilities can grow through dedication and hard work
* Systems Thinking: A holistic approach that looks at the way a system's components interrelate and influence each other and how these components come together within the context of larger systems to deliver a solution.
* Agile Manifesto: The four paired Core Values and associated 12 Principles that set the foundation for all Agile Frameworks
* Agile Principles: Practical guidance for teams to adopt Agile
* Four Paired Core Values: The part of the Agile Manifesto that defines the values that establishes what Agile is for teams and organizations
* Agile Manifesto: The four paired Core Values and associated 12 Principles that set the foundation for all Agile Frameworks
* Agile Principles: Practical guidance for teams to adopt Agile
* Four Paired Core Values: The part of the Agile Manifesto that defines the values that establishes what Agile is for teams and organizations
* *Incremental Product Delivery:* An approach that utilizes a given number of steps, which go from start to finish following a linear path of progression
* *Iterative Product Delivery:* An approach where product development is broken into sequences of time-boxed, repeated cycles called iterations
* *Sequential Product Delivery:* A process where a defined sequence of steps must be followed as in the Waterfall approach


#### The Agile Mindset
When we talk about an Agile Mindset, we include:

Respect
Collaboration
Continuous Improvement
Iterative Learning Cycles
Mastery and Ownership
Focus on Delivering Value
Adaptability to Change


### Agile Manifesto
#### The 4 Agile Core Values
These were developed by 17 industry experts and finalized in 2001. They are:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: Agile places more importance and emphasis on people and their interactions over processes and even tools.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation: Documentation requires time and resource commitment that might be wasteful.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: Agile promotes a collaborative outlook when product owners work with their customers in reaching an agreement on the details of the product delivery.
4. Responding to changes by following a plan:

#### Agile Manifesto Principles
The 12 Agile Principles
The Agile Manifestoâ€™s 4 paired core values drive the 12 Agile Principles. Let's look at the principles in detail.

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. The goal of product development is the development of successful products.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. Due to the dynamic competitive landscape, requirements can and will change throughout product development.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter time scale. Frequent and iterative delivery of working products provides the business with practical feedback.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. The Product Owner and the Agile Team adopt practices that ensure inclusive and joint practices.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. Agile leaders build Agile teams with skilled resources who are willing to work together collaboratively with a growth mindset.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. For a product development team to succeed its members must communicate and collaborate effectively.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress. The primary measure of product development should be the delivery of working product increments, which meet the evolving needs of the business.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. A highly skilled team simply just cannot be expected to successfully develop a product by compelling people to work overtime for extended periods.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Built-in quality practices have enormous benefits. It allows for easier maintenance and scalability of the product.
10. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential. With the guidance of the Product Owner, Agile Teams focus on high-value activities, which allows them to focus on the high business value needs.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. This is a critical principle of the agile world to ensure that emerging and effective architectures, requirements, and designs are built into the product development life cycle to maximize technical excellence.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. Finding concrete opportunities for improvement is a continual effort.

Describes in what scenario the agile methodology works and when it is useless. 

##### Conditions Where Agile May Not Be Helpful:
* Lack of agreement in terms of requirements and process
* No vision and no clear roadmap
* Near certainty on requirements and process upfront
##### Conditions Where Agile Works Best:
* An environment of complexity and some uncertainty where an adaptive approach is needed
* With complicated requirements that need iterative cycles to understand the needs of end-users

### Build & Evolve Agile Teams 

#### New Terms
1. Innovation Hub: Proactively working towards continual improvement with no comprise on technical excellence and quality.
2. Self-Organized: The team determines tasks and makes technical decisions about the work to be done after being given priorities by the Product Owner.
